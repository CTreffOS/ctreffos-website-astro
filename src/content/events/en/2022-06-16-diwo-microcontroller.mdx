During Osnabrück Digital Week 2022, we offer our senseBox:edu workshop again.
In this workshop you can learn how to use and program micro controllers.
Using the senseBox:edu, we guide you step by step through getting it to run, the basics of connectors,
programming using the simplified environment Blockly and controlling sensors and displays.
No prior knowledge needed! By the end you are able to program an IoT weather station or an IoT alarm system.
