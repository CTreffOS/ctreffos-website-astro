In August, the [Hacker Camp WHY2025](https://why2025.org/) will take place in the Netherlands.
We're going too, with 9 people and our [own village](https://wiki.why2025.org/Village:Chaostreff_Osnabr%C3%BCck). You can find us in the [Chaos DACH cluster](https://wiki.why2025.org/Cluster:Chaos_Norden_Westen_Osten_%2B_Austria).

If you're there, come by and say hi!
