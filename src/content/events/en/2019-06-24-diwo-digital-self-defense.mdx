Data leaks, identity theft, government surveillance: Our tracks on the internet are subject to a wide range of daily attacks.
We want to protect ourselves against unauthorized access of our data on the internet.
We will show you how you can secure your browser, encrypt emails or hard drives and configure your smartphone correctly.
Come by and do not forget to bring your your laptops and smartphones.
This workshop by Chaostreff Osnabrück is organized in cooperation with Jugendherberge Osnabrück.
