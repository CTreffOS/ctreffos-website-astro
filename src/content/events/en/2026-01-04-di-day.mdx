We support and participate in the nationwide initiative [Digital Independence Day](https://di.day).

Every first Sunday of the month, we are on-site to offer support for taking steps towards digital independence.

These don't always have to be big steps. Perhaps you'd like to stop buying books or e-books from the big monopolist and instead support your local bookstore. Or you're wondering how to set up an email address with a European provider.

Feel free to drop by with your questions about digital independence. We'll provide advice based on our experience and the collected recipes from the nationwide initiative, offering help for self-help.

If you have specific topic requests, you're welcome to [contact us in advance](/en/contact/) so we can potentially include them in the next or a following event.

Our [Hackspace Rabbithole](/en/hackspace/#directions) is located on the second floor and is unfortunately not barrier-free. If this poses a challenge for you, please [contact us](/en/contact/) - we're happy to find alternatives together.
