In this workshop at digital week 2023 you learn how to build an interactive noise traffic light.
The traffic light will visualize the loudness of the environment using an LED scale.

Additionally we integrate temperature and humidity sensors, so these values can be indicated too.
You do all the wiring and electronics yourself. We will also explain, how the programming of the controller works.
At home you will be able to measure the values of your environment.
