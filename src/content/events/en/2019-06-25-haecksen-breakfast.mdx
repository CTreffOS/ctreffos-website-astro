title: "Haecksen Breakfast"
locationName: "Digital Week"
---

We want to live in a world where female perspectives in tech are taken for granted.
Therefore we meet for breakfast, chatting, networking and thinking about how we can learn from each other.
We invite all humans that consider themselves women.
This includes cis and trans women and non-binary humans, that see themselves in the label "woman".
Haecksen is a group of women interested and working in tech.
Breadrolls, snacks and drinks are provided.
