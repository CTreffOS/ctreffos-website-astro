We have a new website! The first thing you noticed is probably the new appearance. But everything under the hood is new too!
Additionally, a lot of work went into new and improved content.

We now present our hackspace Rabbithole on [its own page](/en/hackspace).
Curious visitors can get an insight into our space with a photo.
To make it easier to find the hackspace, we provide detailed illustrated [directions](/en/hackspace#directions).

To better present the work of our association, we have collected all our talks, workshops, and other events that we held in the past.
The list can be found on the page [About](/en/about).

The events are also used to generate our new calendar. This means we only have to maintain the info in one place.
If you are still subscribed to our old Nextcloud calendar, you should change it to [the new iCal URL](/en/calendar.ics).

We built a similar integration for the news on the homepage, which is now available as an [RSS feed](/en/rss.xml).

Answers to questions that we get a lot can be found in our new [FAQ](/en/faq).

People who would like to know more about the technical side can take a look at our [git repository](https://github.com/CTreffOS/ctreffos-website-astro) or ask us at our hackspace.
If you found a mistake or have feedback, please let us know.
The various ways to reach us can be found on the [contact page](/en/contact).

Have fun exploring!
