title: Completing our Migration to Matrix
description: Discontinuing operation of the bridge to XMPP/Jabber and Telegram

Last year we started shifting our communication from[Jabber/XMPP](https://xmpp.org/) to [Matrix](https://matrix.org/).
For this purpose we have set up a Matrix instance and moved our rooms and activities.

Now it is time to complete the migration. Because of frequent technical problems with mirroring the messages and
because we no longer want to support Telegram, we have decided to take the bridge offline.

On 1st May 2025 we will discontinue our Telegram and XMPP/Jabber channel.
We ask the few that still follow the public chat on these platforms to
instead join our [Matrix chat room](https://matrix.to/#/#public_ctreffos:chaostreff-osnabrueck.de).

People who do not yet have a Matrix account can register with an instance of their choice:

- Members can use [our own instance](https://element.chaostreff-osnabrueck.de/) with their club email address
- Non members can use one of the [countless public instances](https://matrix.org/ecosystem/hosting/)
