# Participate

Want to check out the Chaostreff? Just come by!

We meet every Thursday from 19:00 for **Open Chaos**.
The meetings are explicitly public and everyone interested is warmly invited to just drop by.
You don't need to register, just walk in.

## What happens there?

Mostly we sit together comfortably, tinker, hack or chat.
Some of us are good with technology and computers, others know about gardening, and others are just there for the nice atmosphere.
So it is absolutely not a requirement to be an expert to drop by. You are welcome whether you want to come just once or aspire to membership.

There is usually no fixed program. Therefore it is advisable to bring something of your own to tinker with or show (laptop, hardware project, knitting...), but that is not a must!
You can also just be there, chat or take a look at the Hackspace.

## First Contact

When you follow the directions, just ring the doorbell (sign "Chaostreff").
The first visit to a new group can be exciting.
When you enter the room, everyone might look up at first – that's just curiosity!
Just find a seat or speak to someone.

We are happy to offer you a **small tour** of our rooms to show you everything.
Feel free to grab a drink from the fridge.

If you are unsure or would like to talk to someone before your first visit, feel free to write to us beforehand:

- **Email**: [info@chaostreff-osnabrueck.de](mailto:info@chaostreff-osnabrueck.de)
- **Matrix (Chat)**: [Public Room](https://matrix.to/#/#public_ctreffos:chaostreff-osnabrueck.de)

Our principles are important to us:

- [All creatures welcome](https://help.ccc.de/principles.html#all-creatures-welcome)
- [Be excellent to each other](https://help.ccc.de/principles.html#be-excellent-to-each-other)
