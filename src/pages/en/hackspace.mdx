### By public transportation

The hackspace is located near [Neumarkt](https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/1747348346), the central hub of Osnabr√ºcks bus network.

The VOS provides [a departure board](https://www.vos.info/fahrplaner/#depart!Z%7COsnabr%C3%BCck%20Neumarkt) on their website.

If you arrive by train, get off at Osnabr√ºck Hbf (Osnabr√ºck Central Train Station). To get to the Hackspace/Neumarkt from there, you can take the first bus from bus platform 1. Alternatively you can walk to the Hackspace in 15 minutes.

### By bike

There is a [bike stand](https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/473015925) directly in front of the house. Additional bike parking options can be found on the backside of the [library Alte M√ºnze](https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/1747348346).

### By car

Due to the central location, there is unfortunately no free parking available within the inner city. However, there are several paid parking options in the surrounding area.

Right next to the Hackspace you can find the parking garage [Ledenhof Garage](https://www.parken-osnabrueck.de/parken/parkplatzsuche/detail/parkhaus-ledenhof-garage.html). Information about occupancy and prices can be found on the [OPG website](https://www.parken-osnabrueck.de/parken/parkplatzsuche/detail/parkhaus-ledenhof-garage.html). During large events taking place in the [Osnabr√ºckHalle](https://www.osnabrueckhalle.de/besuchen/programm/) or in the inner city (e.g. Maiwoche), it might be full.

Outside of the ring road it is often possible to park for free, e.g. in the districts W√ºste and Katharinenviertel. Please pay attention to the signage to avoid parking fines.

### Accessibility

Unfortunately our rooms are on the 2nd floor and are not accessible by wheelchair. But we do like to take our meetings outside in the summer, so please write us an [email](/en/contact) and we will see what we can do.

If you need help to find the Hackspace, or for questions, please contact us. During the meetings, you can also reach us via our [hackspace phone](/en/contact).
