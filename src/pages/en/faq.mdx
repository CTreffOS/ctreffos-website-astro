## Can I bring my problems?

Generally yes, we are happy to help, but we cannot promise that someone will take a look at your problem or solve it. After all, we are not an IT service provider.

## What is a Chaostreff, are you not the Chaos Computer Club?

No, we are a regional organization. We are not part of the CCC.
However, we often work together with the CCC, e.g. to organise events or workshops.
More information can be found on the [website of Chaos Computer Club](https://www.ccc.de/en/regional).

## What services does the Chaostreff Osnabrück offer?

For our region, we run [osna.social](https://osna.social), an instance of the social network Mastodon.
Some information can be found in our [news article](en/news/2018-11-17-mastodon/).
At [meet.osna.social](https://meet.osna.social) we offer a platform for video conferences (Jitsi).
In addition, there are also other services such as our Wiki, our Matrix server and our mailing list.

The operation is financed by [donations](/en/donate), membership fees and subsidies.
